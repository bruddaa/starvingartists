Image to Lua Converter is back not as software but now even better: as Discord Bot called "BrudArt".

How to Use?
Using it is really simple just type "_gen example.com" and it will directly generate you the script and mention you, so you know what script is yours.*

How to get Access?
At first 5 people will get access to the bot to test it. Wanne be one of them? Head over to 
‚Å†user-help and let me know.

*Note:

   - The Bot is brand new so expect issues to happen
   - Only use .jpg, .png, etc. image links no "data:" URLs
   - It is recommended to use quadratic images to get the best result
   - Timer can be added too just by adding "timer5" with a space to your command
   - Generating inappropriate Art will get you banned and blacklisted from future projects
   - The bot channel is only used for bot cmds not anything else
   - Wait 3-5 Minutes before submitting to avoid a warning
