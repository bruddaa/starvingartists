This is NOT a script instead its an GUI that is independet to Roblox, that means it's an additional "Software".
Get it here: https://discord.gg/3NqYkMFH2C
Read the included txt file before using.

Features:
- Image URL to Lua script (no "data:" URLs)
- Scripted image preview (how it would look like in-game)
- (Timer for 5min can be added by typing  "    wait(0.3)" above the last script line. WITH the spaces)

Example:
"for i,v in pairs(Pixels) do
    UI[i].BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(v.R, v.G, v.B)
    wait(0.3)
end"


NOTE: Some image URLs may not work (GUI will show very long error) but this is not often the case
If you face any issues you can also get help in the Discord.
